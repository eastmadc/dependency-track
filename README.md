Dependency-Track
=========

OWASP Dependency-Track is an intelligent Software Composition Analysis (SCA) application that allows organizations to automatically ingest and identify third-party components and any inherited vulnerabilities from their use.

The master branch is currently legacy and unsupported. Please see the [3.0-dev](https://github.com/stevespringett/dependency-track/tree/3.0-dev) branch for ongoing Dependency-Track development. 

Roadmap
-
As of October 2017, the current plan is to attempt to get beta releases of 3.0 delivered in December or January. Once betas are delivered, the 3.0-dev branch will become the new master branch.
